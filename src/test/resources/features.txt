1. Persistence of commands
2. Persistence of events. Zero-or-many atomic events per one command.
3. Rebuilding state on start from events, processing commands that have higher sourceSeqs than applied events.
3. Exactly-once command execution on fault restore.
4. Replay starting from given source/sourceSeq until given stop condition persisting output to a separate event file.
